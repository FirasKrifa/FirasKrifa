<em>I am a 4th Year undergraduate student from <a href="https://www.galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/"><b>Galgotias University, Greater Noida </b></a>. From very early on in my life, I started to fall in love with technology üòç This love has helped me develop a very good technological mindset <img src="https://github.com/rajput2107/rajput2107/blob/master/Assets/PC.gif" height="20px"/>, and given me the curiosity to learn more. I firmly believe that **no amount of knowledge <img src="https://github.com/rajput2107/rajput2107/blob/master/Assets/Rocket.gif" height="18px"> is enough knowledge**. üß†</em>

First and foremost, I love to write code. I am obsessed with the idea of 
using software to solve practical problems. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately committed to solving. 
I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people all over the world I love making things that live on the internet,
be it websites, apps, or anything in between. My goal is to always create products that deliver pixel-perfect performance experiences .. since I was little, 
software development has been my passion. I am passionate about learning new technologies and I love working in Agile environments.

I am interested in development tools, such as programming languages, compilers, text editors, and authoring tools.
