- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @FirasKrifa

First and foremost, I love to write code. I am obsessed with the idea of 
using software to solve practical problems. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately committed to solving. 
I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people all over the world I love making things that live on the internet,
be it websites, apps, or anything in between. My goal is to always create products that deliver pixel-perfect performance experiences .. since I was little, 
software development has been my passion. I am passionate about learning new technologies and I love working in Agile environments. 
I have the ability to work in a highly collaborative and independent environment, I like to take on new challenges I want to create software that people love to use. 
I am interested in development tools, such as programming languages, compilers, text editors, and authoring tools.
